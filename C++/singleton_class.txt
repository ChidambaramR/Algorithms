Objective:
==========
	Code a singleton class

Logic:
======
	A singleton class is one, for which only one object can be instantiated. To enable this, the constructor of the class should be
	made private. 
	class Singleton{
		 private static Singleton instance;
		 prinvate Singleton(){
			// Private constructor 
		 }
	
		public static synchronized Singleton getInstance(){
			if(instance == null) // If new, create an instance
				instance = new Singleton();
			return instance;
		}
	}
