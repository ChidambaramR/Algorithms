Fork:
=====
	Fork copies the entire address space from the parent to the child. Modern implementations use a mechanism called Copy-On-Write
	tricks both the processes by sharing the address space by setting the read only bit. When either the parent or the child modifies
	the page, a separate copy is given to them with write bit set.

	Things shared between parent and child on a fork:
	-------------------------------------------------
	   * process credentials (real/effective/saved UIDs and GIDs)
	   * environment
	   * stack
	   * memory
	   * open file descriptors (note that the underlying file positions are
	        shared between the parent and child, which can be confusing)
	   * close-on-exec flags
	   * signal handling settings
	   * nice value
	   * scheduler class
	   * process group ID
	   * session ID
	   * current working directory
	   * root directory
	   * file mode creation mask (umask)
	   * resource limits
	   * controlling terminal

	Things that are unique to child:
	--------------------------------
	   * process ID
	   * different parent process ID
	   * Own copy of file descriptors and directory streams.
	   * process, text, data and other memory locks are NOT inherited.
	   * process times, in the tms struct
	   * resource utilizations are set to 0
	   * pending signals initialized to the empty set
	   * timers created by timer_create not inherited
	   * asynchronous input or output operations not inherited

When a process forks, all open file descriptors are also inherited. i.e a separate copy is put in the child process. So even if the child closes tht socket it is not reflected to the parent. Only the reference count of the open socket descriptors is decremented. The socket will be removed only if the reference count becomes 0.
