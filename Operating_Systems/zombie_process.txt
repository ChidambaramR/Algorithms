Zombie process:
===============
	When a program forks a child and the child completes before the parent, the kernel still keeps some information
	about the child in the case its parent needs it (wait system call)
	The interval between the child terminating and the parent calling wait, the child is said to be in a 'zombie'.
	ps lists the process state as Z. 
	Eventhough it is not running, it takes up an entry in the process table. It consumes no other resources. 
	To prevent a process from the entering the zombie state, the parent should call wait / waitpid for every child. 

	If the parent dies before collecting the status of the child, then the child becomes an orphaned process and is
	reaped by the init process. The init is the 1st process to be loaded after the system boots.
