Difference between little endian and big endian

They are just different in the way they are interpreted. 
Intel uses little endian
PowerPC uses big endian
Little endian is easy for the processors to read data. The least significatn byte goes into lower address.
When moving from a 32 bit machine to 64 bit machine, little endian is easier because we can easily add 0's to the starting.
i.e in a 32 bit little endian machine, number 87888990 is representes as follows
0x100 90
0x101 89
0x102 88
0x103 87

Same number is big endian machine is
0x100 87
0x101 88
0x102 89
0x103 90


Now if we move to 64 bit, little endian is just appending 00's to rest of 4 bytes. But in big endian we need to move the bytes
This is a little bit overhead
