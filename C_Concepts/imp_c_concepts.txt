1. Are the two statements same? *ptr++ and ++*ptr?
    No. *ptr++ increments the pointer alone and does not touch the value in it. 
        ++*ptr incrmenets the value being pointed to by the pointer. This also can be done by (*ptr)++

2. What is the equivalent pointer expression for a[i][j][k][l]?
    *(*(*(*(a+i)+j)+k)+l)
    'a' is the base address of the 4D array.
